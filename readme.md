# Welcome, below is a list of some of the projects I have done.

### Server 1: SKYNET
This server is setup as my main server. It has [CasaOS](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS) installed to make installing docker containers easier. 

Directly installed with CasaOS is [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) which is a very simple docker container that is used to monitor devices and services. It can be configured to send an http, ping or keyword request to any site (including port) and report back via a telegram bot if the status changes. 




  more info about casaos: It uses it's own offical repositories and allows third party ones, but also allows easy importing of official or custom docker containers from whatever source you want. The safest practice here is to choose only official containers.
